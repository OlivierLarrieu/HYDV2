HYDV2
=====

HYDV2 new version of hydv desktop from Hybryde distribution
It is only python codding !!!

I just start the project on  january 2014.
It is devoloped on Ubuntu 13.10, but i'm going to implement a virtual env for it in the hope it will be right for every distros.
For the moment, download the repo and do with your terminal and go in the corresponding folder, so do ; python main.py.
i assume than for the moment tis is doing nothing more more than a bar.
All the rest is comming soon, when i'll have the time to do.
