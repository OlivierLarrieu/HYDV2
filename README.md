HYDV2
=====

HYDV2 new version of hydv desktop from Hybryde distribution
It is only python codding !!!

I just start the project o, january of 2014.
It is devoloped on Ubuntu 13.10, but i'm going to implement a virtual env for it.
For the moment, download the repo and do with your terminal go in the corresponding folder, so do ; python main.py.
i assume than for the moment tis is doing nothing more more than a bar.
All the rest is comming soon, when i'll have the time to do.
